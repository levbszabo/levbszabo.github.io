## Systematic FX Alpha from State-Space Neural Networks

**Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Domain:** Quantitative Finance, Machine Learning, Algorithmic Trading  
**Research Paper:** [ðŸ“„ State-Space FX Alpha: Technical Summary (PDF)](/pdf/fx_trading_systematic.pdf)

### Executive Summary

I developed a sophisticated FX trading system that combines deterministic state-space neural networks with confidence-gated signal generation to achieve **Sharpe ratios exceeding 2.0** on in-sample data and **1.75 out-of-sample**. The system processes hourly FX data across 7 major currency pairs through a Dreamer-style world model to predict multi-horizon returns, then uses statistical confidence gating and advanced portfolio construction to generate consistent alpha.

### Key Innovation: Confidence-Weighted Signal Generation

The core breakthrough is using **distributional forecasts** rather than point estimates. For each currency pair and time horizon (24h, 168h), the model predicts not just expected returns (Î¼) but also uncertainty (Ïƒ), allowing us to compute confidence scores:

```
z-score = Î¼ / Ïƒ
```

**Signal Logic:**
- **Entry decisions** based on 168h z-scores exceeding calibrated thresholds
- **24h horizon** acts as a timing/sizing filter (boost positions when aligned, reduce when opposed)
- **No requirement for both horizons to agree** - this allows more flexibility while maintaining signal quality

### Architecture: Deterministic State-Space Networks

**Model Components:**
- **Observation Encoder**: Transforms OHLCV + derived features into latent embeddings
- **RSSM (Recurrent State Space Model)**: Learns temporal market dynamics in latent space  
- **Distributional Head**: Predicts Student-t parameters (Î¼, Ïƒ, Î½) for heteroscedastic returns
- **Deterministic Mode**: Direct latent mapping for cleaner trading signals (vs stochastic training mode)

The model processes 512-hour sequences across 7 FX majors (EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY) using data from 2018-2025.

### Advanced Risk Management

**Portfolio Construction:**
- **USD-neutral cross-sectional selection**: Top-K strongest longs, bottom-K strongest shorts by |z_168h|
- **Volatility-aware position sizing**: Scale by predicted uncertainty and realized volatility
- **Ïƒ-scaled exits**: Dynamic take-profit/stop-loss based on model confidence rather than fixed percentages

**Risk Controls:**
- **Drawdown brake**: Halve exposure during >7% drawdowns until 50% recovery
- **Portfolio volatility targeting**: Scale to maintain ~30% annualized vol
- **Weekend risk management**: Flatten positions before gaps
- **Per-pair and gross leverage caps**

### Signal Validation: Ventile Analysis

I validated predictive power by sorting forecasts into ventiles (20 equal buckets) based on z-scores:
- **168h horizon**: Shows clear monotonic relationship between z-scores and realized returns
- **24h horizon**: Noisier but provides valuable timing information for position sizing

### Performance Results

**In-Sample (2019-2024):**
- Sharpe Ratio: **2.20**
- CAGR: **7.16%**  
- Max Drawdown: **-11.09%**
- Win Rate: **51.3%**

**Out-of-Sample (2025 YTD):**
- Sharpe Ratio: **1.75** 
- CAGR: **15.87%**
- Max Drawdown: **-3.85%**
- Win Rate: **52.7%**

*All results are net of realistic transaction costs (0.9-1.5 pip spreads)*

### Technical Implementation

**Data Pipeline:**
- Hourly FX data with comprehensive feature engineering (15+ derived features per symbol)
- Per-symbol standardization to prevent look-ahead bias
- Train/validation/test temporal splits with proper out-of-sample evaluation

**Model Training:**
- Deterministic state-space architecture for production consistency
- Student-t likelihood for robust tail modeling
- <10ms inference latency for real-time trading

**Cost Modeling:**
- Realistic spread-based transaction costs
- Half-spread charged at entry/exit
- Turnover optimization (average hold ~2-4 days)

### Research Contributions

1. **Ïƒ-based Risk Management**: Using model uncertainty for dynamic position sizing and exits
2. **Multi-horizon Signal Fusion**: Systematic combination of 24h/168h forecasts without requiring agreement
3. **Cross-sectional USD Neutrality**: Market-neutral FX momentum strategy
4. **Deterministic State-Space Trading**: First application to systematic FX alpha generation
